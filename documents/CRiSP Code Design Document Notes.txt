Done up to 1.1 Graphical User Interface
1.1: Not really sure about the data analysis tools...

Document usage of vectors (array of doubles, first one is the length, I guess)
There is very little documentation on how the GUI works
-Namely, what IDCs are and why they're used
-Also, the global event thing should be covered (since it's weird)

The numbering of sections is completely messed up, I think
